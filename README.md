# Base64 Encode/Decode

This is an extension that provides a tool window within Visual Studio that provides you with the ability to Base64 encode (or decode) text. Instead of bouncing out to your favorite web browser to encode/decode your data, you can do it from the comfort of the Visual Studio IDE!

## Using the Base64 Encode/Decode Tool Window

Once you have installed the extension, click on the **View** menu, **Other Windows** and then **Base64 Encode/Decode**. Once the tool window has been displayed, you can dock the window anywhere you like, just like any other window in Visual Studio.

If desired, you can add a toolbar button to an existing (or new) toolbar for quick access. See the screenshots below for an example of where a toolbar button has been added.
